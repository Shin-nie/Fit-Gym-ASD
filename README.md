# React + Vite + Node.js

To run our program you will need to do the following in the terminal:

Inside the /Frontend directory

  1. npm install
  2. npm run dev

   And the program will give you a localhost address for the website.

In a separate Terminal window inside the /Backend directory run the following commands:

  1. npm install
  2. npm start


After completing the following and navigating to the localhost URL from the Frontend directory you will be able to see the website with live data from the DB.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
