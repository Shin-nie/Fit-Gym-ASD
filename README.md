# React + Vite

To run our program you will need to do 2 things in the terminal:

1. npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2 chartjs-plugin-zoom chartjs-adapter-moment moment
2. npm install react-modal

After this you can then type:

1. npm run dev 

And the program will give you a localhost address for the website.


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
